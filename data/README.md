# Data directory

This repository intentionally ships a few **derived** artifacts so the MPFST
figures can be reproduced without re-running every public download. Nothing
proprietary or raw is included: the NumPy arrays either come from PhysioNet
(`ds006036`, aka eegmmidb) or the Dryad vFLIP/vIPFC release, and all scripts
for recreating them live under `scripts/`.

You will therefore see subfolders such as:

- `eegmmidb_all_theta_abg_vq035/`, `eegmmidb_results/`, `eegmmidb_movements_*` —
  summaries generated by `scripts/run_eegmmidb_batch.py` and
  `scripts/pool_avalanche_tails.py` after mirroring PhysioNet locally.
- `flip_example*_vlPFC_concat.npy`, `vflip2_raw.npy`, and the corresponding
  `_mpfst/` folders — Dryad FLIP/vIPFC excerpts converted via
  `scripts/convert_dryad_lfp_to_npy.py` and then processed with
  `scripts/run_full_pipeline.py`.
- `physionet.org/` and `doi_10_5061_dryad_9w0vt4bnp__v20251104/` — mirrors of
  the two public datasets once you run the helper download/conversion scripts.

For step-by-step regeneration commands (including exact CLI invocations), see
`data/README_DATA.md` and the "Reproducing the shipped artifacts" section in the
top-level `README.md`.
